# XOmiVAE

**An interpretable deep learning model for cancer classification using high-dimensional omics data**

### Introduction
-  XOmiVAE is a novel interpretable deep learning model for cancer classification using high-dimensional omics data.
-  XOmiVAE provides contribution of each input molecular feature and latent dimension to the prediction.
-  XOmiVAE is able to explain unsupervised clusters produced by the VAE clustering part of the network.
-  XOmiVAE explanations of the downstream prediction were evaluated by biological annotation and literature, which aligned with current domain knowledge.
-  XOmiVAE shows great potential for novel biomedical knowledge discovery from deep learning models.

For examples of how to implement the code, see main.py. The explainable functions are in omiShapExplainer.py.
